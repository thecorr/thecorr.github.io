    <h1 class="page-title">PHILOSOPHIES & BELIEFS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Philosophies, religions and beliefs are all ways of thinking about the world or rules about how to live your life. Sometimes there are also beliefs about what's after life as well. This is referred to as the Afterlife. The unusual thing about religion and philosophies is that people look at the same source and interpret it so differently.</p>
    <h2>Roman Catholicism</h2>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church are a huge religious organisation (one of the oldest religious institutions in the world). Roman Catholics is the term for its practitioners. They believe in one god (or are monotheistic). They have a sacred text known as "The Bible", which, according to them, is the word of God himself. Roman Catholics live their lives by the Ten Commandments, which are the divine laws that god gave to Moses on Mount Sinai. If they follow the Bible, go to Mass, and observe the Ten Commandments, they believe when they die they will live eternally in Heaven.</p>
    <h2>Catholic History and the Bible</h2>
<p>Christianity emerged around 0 AD. The official split between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church occurred in 1054. The Western Christian Church had split in 1560. The rift was caused mainly by German monk Martin Luther. He posted 95 complaints on the door of a church in Saxony. He originally only wished to reform the Catholic Church, but he was expelled from the Church, and so he formed the Protestant Church. This has led to many years of bitter religious wars.</p>
<p>The Bible is the holy scripture of the Roman Catholics. It is divided into two parts, the Old Testament (teachings from before Christ), and the New Testament (during the life of Jesus Christ). There are 46 books in the Roman Catholic Old Testament and 27 books in the New Testament. The Bible doesn't belong solely to the Roman Catholics, however. Many other religions base their teachings on The Bible.</p>
<h2>Symbols and Symbolism</h2>
<p>The symbol of the Roman Catholic Church is the cross. This is symbolic of the wooden cross Jesus was crucified on. There are other, more minor symbols, such as the dove, the anchor, and the shamrock. The dove signifies the Holy Spirit, God’s guide who resides in everybody who is baptised.</p>

    <h2>Celebrations and Rituals</h2>
<p>The major celebrations of the Roman Catholic Church are: Easter Sunday and Christmas Day. Christmas is on the 25th of December, and is to celebrate Jesus’s birth. Interestingly, Christmas has grown into a holiday period around the world, even for those of other religions (and none). The date of Easter varies every year. Easter is to celebrate Jesus dying to save us all, and then being resurrected after three days to tell his disciples that he was going to Heaven to “live eternally by the right hand of God”.</p>
    <p>The most important Christian rituals are the 7 Sacraments, Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance and Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Marriage. “Practicing” Catholics also attend Mass weekly, and eat a piece of “bread” (a small, wafer-like circle) which is symbolic of the bread that Jesus broke at the Last Supper and told his disciples “Eat this, for this is my body”.</p>
